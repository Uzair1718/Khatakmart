- Background color: Soft, desaturated off-white (#F5F5DC). Provides a clean, calming backdrop that ensures focus on products. Consistent hue as the primary.
- Accent color: Earthy yellow (#B8860B) for highlighting important elements and call-to-action buttons. Its a distinct departure from the primary color in both brightness and saturation, but stays close to green on the color wheel.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a modern serif for headlines and titles, adding elegance.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', A clean and readable sans-serif for body text and product descriptions.
- Use clear and simple icons to represent product categories, shopping cart actions, and payment methods.
- A grid-based layout for product listings, a clean header navigation, and a single-column checkout process.
- Subtle animations when adding items to the cart or updating order status.
